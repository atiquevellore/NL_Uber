Tableau Viz link: Uber_dashboard(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/md.atique.bokhari/viz/NL_UBER/FinalDashboard)
Overview
This project analyzes a 6.5 million-row Uber driver dataset to optimize Revenue per Driver Hour (RDH) in Bangalore. The objective is to identify demand patterns, reduce idle times, and propose strategies to enhance fleet efficiency and driver earnings.

## Objectives
- Identify key demand trends and revenue drivers.
- Provide recommendations to optimize driver deployment and reduce cancellations.
- Enhance RDH through data-driven insights.

## Methodology
-Data Cleaning: Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) in Jupyter Notebook to clean data, handling missing values and capping outliers (e.g., fare_amount).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to identify peak revenue hours (5-6 AM, 4-6 PM), high-revenue areas (e.g., Yelahanka New Town), and cancellation trends.
-Visualization: Created dashboards with Tableau to highlight demand and revenue patterns.
- Recommendations: Proposed surge pricing, incentives for 3-4 passenger trips, and cancellation penalties.
